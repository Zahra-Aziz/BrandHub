BrandHub is an online application that connects the world of shopping with all the brands
at one place. One can search their favorite clothing items, make comparisons and choose
the best products on one platform! Got a picture of what you want but don’t know where to
get it from? The app will display all the similar matches. Want to be specific about your
clothing items? Simply provide key words and the app will show results. With this app,

Make a match with a specific item by uploading a picture and letting the app do the work
for you. Provide a budget and number of items needed, the app will display the most
efficient combinations based on the user’s personal style.
This app is all about saving the time that you spend on browsing and searching for items of
your choice. This project combines various technical challenges such as Web scraping,
image detection, object detection, data analysis and recommendation engine.

We've used Flask JS API for communication of data between our UI, which is React JS, and
the Python backend scripts, which process the query through the required algorithm, by
fetching the required data from MongoDB. So React and Flask doesn't has to interact with
MongoDB, python scripts maintain a standalone relationship. If there will be required, a
direct communication between React and Mongo DB, Express JS will be used, hence the 
MERN stack will be deployed.
